<p>
Welcome to my C tutorial! In this tutorial you will learn everything you
need to know to write anything you want in C.
</p>

<p>
This tutorial will be relatively in depth, however, you will probably need some surface level knowledge on common ideas.<br>
If you can answer these questions, then you will be fine.

<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>
C was developed between 1972 and 1973 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in order to create utility programs for the Unix operating system.
It was then used to rewrite core components of Unix.
</p>

<p>
After its adoption by standards like ANSI in 1989 and ISO in 1990 it started to gain a lot of popularity.
</p>

<p>
Now that it was standardised it was much easier for programmers to use and make their programs work across operating systems.
Before its standardization, the only true "standard" was K&R,
which comes from a book written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie simply called <i>The C Programming Language</i>.
</p>

<h3 id="about">About C</h3>
<p>
C is a general purpose programming language, meaning that it's not designed to do anything specific,
and can be applied across many applications.
C is particularly good for operating systems and device drivers, and also has notable use for creating
database software.
C is also very synonymous with Unix, as it was developed around the same time by the same people.
You will notice that Unix and Unix-like operating systems make exstensive use of C for most applications.
</p>

<p>
C is a very fast language thanks to it being compiled (more about compilers
in <a href="hello-world.html">Hello World</a>), and it can produce smaller binaries than other compiled languages.
It is also very simple, it does not come with very many libraries or premade structures.
C is also very cross platform. You would be very hard pressed to find an operating system or computer that cannot run C.
</p>

<p>
Since its release there have been multiple iterations usually called standards or versions. Those versions are
K&R C, C89 (ANSI C) / C90 (ISO C), C99, C11, C17, and the upcoming C2x.
The general rule of thumb with these is that the older it is, the more portable it is (meaning it will run on more computers).
While the newer it is, the more feature-rich it is.
The sweet spot between portability and usability is either C89 or C99.
</p>

<p>
Using K&R C is usually not necessary unless you are working with very old systems, and again, it was barely a standard to begin with.
This tutorial will focus on C99, but I will be sure to mention anything that will not work in C89.

<h3 id="important-information">Important Information</h3>
<p>
Some important information to note for this tutorial is listed below.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Any line that starts with a dollar sign ($) is a command that
        you should run in your terminal. anything after that line is the output.</li>
    <li>Any code that starts at column 1 is a full program or full function. Anything that starts
    with four spaces in front of it is a code snippet, and will not compile on its own.</li>
</ul>
