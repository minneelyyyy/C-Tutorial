<h1 id="variables">Variables</h1>

<p>
Data is a very important concept in the world of programming.
The whole point of programming is manipulating data. C offers us a method
of storing data called a variable.
</p>

<p>
A variable is a way of storing named data. For example: <code>favorite_number = 7</code>.
This is a variable named "favorite_number" and it stores the number 7.
</p>

<h4>Creating a variable in C</h4>

<p>
To create a variable in C, you will need to this:
</p>

<pre>
    <i>data-type</i> <i>variable-name</i> [= <i>value</i>]
</pre>


<p>
If you don't give a variable a value immediately, its value is undefined.<br>
If you do, then it will be set to value
</p>

<i>example of defining some variables:</i>
<pre>
    int x = 5;
    int y;
</pre>

<i>example of defining multiple variables in one line:</i>
<pre>
    int x, y = 4, z;
</pre>

<p>
If you would like to set a variable after it's been created, use the <code>=</code> operator.
</p>

<pre>
    /* x is created, but no value is assigned */
    int x;

    /* you can set x's value later */
    x = 5;
</pre>

<h4>What happens if you don't set a variable?</h4>
<p>
If a variable can only store the data type it is given, what does it store
when you don't give it a value? Well, let's find out.<br>
Compile and run this program to see what happens.
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void) {
    int x;
    printf("%d\n", x);

    return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
If you run this code, you might notice that it is 0, or it might be any other random number.
The truth is, I can't predict what it will be. This is called <b>undefined behavior</b> in C.
What that means is it totally depends on your compiler and operating system.<br>
It will most commonly be what data was already at the memory it is given.
</p>

<h3 id="data-types">Data Types</h3>
<p>
A data type is used to define what data a variable stores. This is used so that
programmers, as well as the language itself, knows what to do with and use it for.<br>
There are 3 main types of data in C, <b>integers</b>, <b>floats</b>, and <b>pointers</b>.
</p>

<h4>Integers</h4>
<p>
You have probably heard this term in math class. An integer is any number without a decimal point, like 15 or -12.<br>
To declare an integer, you use the <code>int</code> keyword.
</p>

<i>example of creating an integer:</i>
<pre>
    int x = 5;
</pre>

<h4>Floats</h4>
<p>
A float is a number that can have a decimal such as 5.5 or -12.2.<br>
To declare a float, you use the <code>float</code> keyword.
</p>

<i>example of creating a float:</i>
<pre>
    float y = 5.5;
</pre>

<h4>Pointers</h4>
<p>
A pointer is a special data type that is used to store a memory address.
</p>

<p>
Pointers are most often used to store a string, which is some data that stores letters.
A char (character) pointer can be used to reference a string.<br>
To declare a char pointer, you can use the <code>char</code> keyword, with an asterisk before the variable name.
</p>

<i>example of creating a char pointer:</i>
<pre>
    char *str = "hello";
</pre>

<h3 id="sizes">Sizes</h3>
<p>
Ints and floats have multiple sizes, and you use different keywords to give them a specified size.<br>
</p>

<p>
What do I mean by size? By that I mean how many bytes in memory that a data type takes up.
Bytes are individual sections of bits and can represent different types of data, however
they have a very limited amount of information they can store.<br>
Multiple bytes can be used to allow for storage of much larger data sets. Check out the table below.
</p>

<h4>A table of sizes</h4>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Size</th>
        <th>Range / Precision</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>char</th>
        <th>1 byte</th>
        <th>-128 to 127</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>short</th>
        <th>2 bytes</th>
        <th>-32766 to 32767</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>int</th>
        <th>4 bytes</th>
        <th>-2147483648 to 2147483647</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>long</th>
        <th>8 bytes</th>
        <th>-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>float</th>
        <th>4 bytes</th>
        <th>7 digits</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>double</th>
        <th>8 bytes</th>
        <th>15 digits</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>any pointer</th>
        <th>8 bytes</th>
        <th>0x0 to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF</th>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
The integers have a fixed max and min value, the floats are given a precision to a number of digits,
and pointers are represented with hexadecimal, which is commonly used to represent pointer values or byte values.<br>
Hexadecimal is a number system just like decimal. Where decimal is base 10 (uses 10 digits),
hexadecimal is base 16 (16 digits, 0-9,A-F), and 2 hexadecimal digits can represent a single byte.
</p>

<p>
Note: These numbers are based on gcc running on my Linux system. These sizes are not
constant, and can vary across compilers. For example in Windows, <code>long</code> is 4 bytes.<br>
Other than that, these numbers tend to remain the same.
</p>

<h3 id="unsigned">Unsigned Integers</h3>
<p>
Any of the integer types can have <code>unsigned</code> added to them.<br>
Unsigned variables are like ints but they can only represent positive numbers, aka 0 to max.
This is useful for times when you don't want or expect a number to be negative.
</p>

<i>an example of creating an unsigned integer:</i>
<pre>
    unsigned int x = 5;
</pre>

<p>
If you attempt to set an unsigned variable to a negative number, it can either give you
an error or just convert it.
</p>
