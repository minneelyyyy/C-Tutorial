<h1>Hello World</h1>

<p>
A hello world program is a very common first step in learning a programming language.
The goal of a hello world program is simple: print hello world.
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
</pre>

<h3>Compiling</h3>
<p>
Compiling is the process of converting source code into a machine readable format called machine code.
Machine code used to be written by hand, but that was a big task and was slow, programming languages were
created to make this part easier.
</p>
<p>
Assembly was the first version of more human readable code. Today, assembly is considered
very old-school and is not commonly used outside of very specific use cases.<br>
Assembly is very close to the machine code that a CPU reads, but it is not exactly 1:1. Assembly is also different across CPUs.
However, back when it was created it was very useful.<br>
Assembly programs are generally not <i>compiled</i> but are <i>assembled</i> using an assembler.
Assembly is also used as an intermediate stage when compiling higher level languages like C.
</p>
<p>
The level after assembly is a compiled language like C. C is compiled into assembly, which
is then assembled down to machine code. This is because converting C to assembly is much easier than converting C directly to machine code.
</p>
<h3>How to compile C</h3>
The steps are different on different operating systems. AS OF NOW THIS TUTORIAL WILL ONLY COVER UNIX.

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>
The first step is to install a compiler if it is not already installed.
This process can vary wildly across every operating system so you're going to have to look this one up.<br>
A good search query should be "how to install a c compiler on X" where X is your operating system.<br>

The most popular compiler is known as gcc and can be installed on virtually any operating system.

Generally though, you should check if cc is available on the system. If not, you probably don't already have a compiler.<br>

CC is not a compiler in itself, but it is usually just a link to a compiler. That compiler is often gcc,
but that will depend on your operating system and if you've installed any other compilers.
</p>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>
The second step is to put your code into a file to store it. You will want to put the code in a file ending in <code>.c</code>.<br>
Copy the hello world program above and paste it into a file called <code>hello.c</code>.
</p>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>
The third and final step is to compile the program. You will need to run the compiler, providing it with the source files you wish to compile.
<pre>$ cc hello.c</pre>
After running this, you should have a file called <code>a.out</code>, to run it, do
<pre>
$ ./a.out
Hello, world!
</pre>
