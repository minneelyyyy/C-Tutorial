<h1 id="hello-world">Hello World</h1>

<p>
A hello world program is a very common first step in learning a programming language.
The goal of a hello world program is simple: print hello world.
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
</pre>

<h3 id="compiling">Compiling</h3>
<p>
Compiling is the process of converting source code into a machine readable format called machine code.
Machine code used to be written by hand, but that was a big task and was slow; programming languages were
created to make this part easier.
</p>

</pre>

<p>
Assembly was the first version of more human readable code. When it was created it made programming a lot easier; today, assembly is considered
very old-school and is not commonly used outside of very specific use cases.
Assembly is very close to the machine code that a CPU reads, but it is not exactly 1:1. Assembly is also different across CPUs.
Assembly programs are generally not <i>compiled</i> but are <i>assembled</i> using an assembler.
Assembly is also used as an intermediate stage when compiling higher level languages like C.
</p>

<pre>
    movq $5, -4(%rbp)
</pre>

<p>
The level after assembly is a compiled language like C. C is compiled into assembly, which
is then assembled down to machine code. This is because converting C to assembly is much
easier than converting C directly to machine code.

<h3 id="how-to-compile-c">How to Compile C</h3>
<p>
The steps are different on different operating systems. AS OF NOW THIS TUTORIAL WILL ONLY COVER UNIX.
</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>
The first step is to install a compiler if it is not already installed.
This process can vary wildly across every operating system so you're going to have to look this one up;
a good search query should be "how to install a c compiler on X" where X is your operating system.
</p>

<p>
The most popular compiler is gcc and can be installed on virtually any operating system.
Generally though, you should check if cc is available on the system. If not, you probably don't already have a compiler.
CC is not a compiler in itself, but it is usually just a link to a compiler. That compiler is often gcc,
but that will depend on your operating system and if you've installed any other compilers.
</p>

<p>
You will also need somewhere to write your code. Every OS will come with a text editor. Here are some popular ones.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>vi/vim</li>
    <li>nano</li>
    <li>notepad++</li>
    <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
    <li>Atom</li>
    <li>Sublime Text</li>
</ul>

<p>
Another option is to install an IDE (integrated development environment).
This is a program that you can write your code in. It will also automate the process of compiling and running your code,
as well as giving you helpful tools like a debugger.
This tutorial will not cover the installation of an IDE, but here's some popular ones.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Visual Studio (Windows and MacOS)</li>
    <li>Code::Blocks (Windows, Linux, MacOS)</li>
    <li>Codelite (Windows, Linux, MacOS)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>
The second step is to put your code into a file to store it. You will want to put the code in a file ending in <code>.c</code>.<br>
Copy the hello world program above and paste it into a file called <code>hello.c</code>.
</p>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>
The third and final step is to compile the program.
You will need to run the compiler, providing it with the source files you wish to compile.
</p>

<pre>$ cc hello.c</pre>

<p>
After running this, you should have a file called <code>a.out</code>, to run it, do
</p>

<pre>
$ ./a.out
Hello, world!
</pre>

<h3 id="explaining-the-program">Explaining the Program</h3>
<p>
You may be wondering what the code is actually doing. We will cover every line of code in this section.
None of this information will go too in depth, parts that mention a specific feature will link to their sections.
</p>

<i>A reminder of what a hello world looks like:</i>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
</pre>

1. <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code><br>
This is a <a href="preprocessor.html">preprocessor</a> statement.
Specifically, this is an include statement. This will allow you to use functionality from libraries.
<code>stdio.h</code> contains useful functions and structures for writing to
and reading from standard input and output, AKA the terminal.<br>
<br>

2. A blank line. C ignores this line but it is used to make the code more readable.<br>
<br>

3. <code>int main() {</code><br>
This is the start of a function, we will discuss more about <a href="functions.html">functions</a> later.
The <code>main</code> function is special because it is expected for every program, it is considered the
entry point of the program, and is where code execution begins for the program. It can also take <a href="cmdargs.html">arguments</a>.
It also returns an <a href="variables.html#datatypes">int</a>, which is used as the <a href="retcodes.html">exit code</a> of the program.<br>
<br>

4. <code>printf("Hello, World!\n");</code><br>
This is a function call. We are calling the function <code>printf</code> which is used to print information to the terminal.
Take special notice of the <code>\n</code>, which is known as a newline. The newline will make the terminal go to the beginning of the next line.<br>
<br>

5. <code>return 0;</code><br>
This is a return statement. It will end execution of the function and return the value provided to it.
We talk more about return values in the <a href="functions.html">functions</a> section.<br>
<code>main</code> is special, because what it returns is also the <a href="retcodes.html">exit code</a> of the program.
On most operating systems, 0 is understood to mean OK, while any other value means there was an error.<br>
Note: in C99 and beyond, this line is not necessary, and it will be implied to return 0. This only applies to the <code>main</code> function.<br>
<br>

6. <code>}</code><br>
This simply closes the function body.<br><br>
