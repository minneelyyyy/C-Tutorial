<h1>Data Types</h1>

<p>
Data is a very important concept in the world of programming.
The whole point of programming is manipulating data. C offers us a method
of storing data called a variable.
</p>

<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>
A variable is a way of storing named data. For example: <code>favorite_number = 7</code>.<br>
This is a variable named "favorite_number" and it stores the number 7.
</p>

<p>
A data type is used to define what data a variable stores. This is used so that
programmers, as well as the language itself, knows what to do with and use it for.
</p>

<p>
To define a variable in C, you will need to do one of:
<pre>
    data-type variable-name = value;
    data-type variable-name;
</pre>
The first will create a variable named <code>variable-name</code> with the type <code>data-type</code>,
and assign it the value of <code>value</code>.<br>
The second will will create a variable named <code>variable-name</code> with the type <code>data-type</code>,
but will not assign it any value.<br>

Tip: You can chain declarations like this, and you can set values for some while not setting values for others.
<pre>
int x, y = 4, z;
</pre>
In this code, we create x, y, and z. Only y will be initialized with the value 4.
</p>

<p>
If you would like to set a variable after it's been created, use the <code>=</code> operator.
<pre>
/* x is created, but no value is assigned */
int x;

/* you can set x's value later */
x = 5;
</pre>
</p>

<h3>What data types are there?</h3>
<p>
There are 3 main types of data in C, <code>integers</code>, <code>floats</code>, and <code>pointers</code>.
</p>

<h4>Integers</h4>
<p>
You have probably heard this term in math class. An integer is any number without a decimal point, like 15 or -12.<br>
To declare an integer, you can use the <code>int</code> keyword.
<pre>
int x = 5;
</pre>
</p>

<h4>Floats</h4>
<p>
A float is a number that can have a decimal such as 5.5 or -12.2.<br>
To declare a float, you can use the <code>float</code> keyword.
<pre>
float y = 5.5;
</pre>
</p>

<h4>Pointers</h4>
<p>
A pointer is a special data type that is used to store a memory address.
These are too complicated to explain right now, so I will break up their main uses
into multiple sections (see <a href="strings.html">strings</a> and <a href="pointers.html">pointers</a>).<br>

Pointers are most often used to store a string, which is some data that stores letters.
A char (character) pointer can be used to reference a string.<br>

A pointer can point to any data type you want, for a string its most useful to use the <code>char</code> type.<br>
To declare a char pointer, you can use the <code>char</code> keyword, with an asterisk before the variable name.
<pre>
char *str = "hello";
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Sizes</h3>
<p>
Ints and floats have multiple sizes, and you use different keywords to give them a specified size.<br>
<br>
What do I mean by size? By that I mean how many bytes in memory that a data type takes up.
Bytes are individual sections of bits and can represent different types of data, however
they have a very limited amount of information they can store<br>
Multiple bytes can be used to allow for storage of much larger data sets. Check out the table below.
</p>

<h4>A table of sizes</h4>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Size</th>
        <th>Range / Precision</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>char</th>
        <th>1 byte</th>
        <th>-128 to 127</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>short</th>
        <th>2 bytes</th>
        <th>-32766 to 32767</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>int</th>
        <th>4 bytes</th>
        <th>-2147483648 to 2147483647</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>long</th>
        <th>8 bytes</th>
        <th>-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>float</th>
        <th>4 bytes</th>
        <th>7 digits</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>double</th>
        <th>8 bytes</th>
        <th>15 digits</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>any pointer</th>
        <th>8 bytes</th>
        <th>0x0 to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF</th>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
The integers have a fixed max and min value, the floats are given a precision to a number of digits,
and pointers are represented with hexadecimal, which is commonly used to represent pointer values or byte values.<br>
Hexadecimal is a number system just like decimal. Where decimal is base 10 (aka it uses 10 digits),
hexadecimal is base 16 (16 digits, 0-9,A-F), and 2 hexadecimal digits can represent a single byte.
</p>

<h3>Unsigned</h3>
<p>
Any of the integer types can have <code>unsigned</code> added to them.<br>
Unsigned variables are like ints but they can only represent positive numbers, aka 0 to max.
This is useful for times when you don't want or expect a number to be negative.<br>
To create an unsigned int, use this:

<pre>
unsigned int x = 5;
</pre>

If you attempt to set an unsigned variable to a negative number, it can either give you
an error or just convert it.
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Size</th>
        <th>Max Value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>char</th>
        <th>1 byte</th>
        <th>255</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>short</th>
        <th>2 bytes</th>
        <th>65535</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>int</th>
        <th>4 bytes</th>
        <th>4294967295</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>long</th>
        <th>8 bytes</th>
        <th>18446744073709551615</th>
    </tr>

<h3>Printf Formats</h3>
<p>
In C, it's not common for a function to be allowed to take just any type
and handle it correctly. So there is no <code>print(5)</code> and then <code>print(12.2)</code>.<br>
In C, to print a variable that isn't a string the most common approach is to use printf.<br>
The f in printf stands for format, and formatting is the most powerful part of printf.
To print an integer, all you have to do is:

<pre>
int x = 5;
printf("%d\n", x);
</pre>

<code>printf</code> takes a format string, and format specifiers all start with a %, then some characters
to define what the format should look like. The format specifiers are optional, as we saw in our hello world program.
You will provide things like size, type, right-aligned, 0 padding, etc.<br>
I suggest you look up how to use printf in more detail.
</p>

<h4>Format Specifiers</h4>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>%d</th>
        <th>Integer</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>%u</th>
        <th>Unsigned Integer</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>%f</th>
        <th>Float</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>%s</th>
        <th>String</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>%c</th>
        <th>Character</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>%p</th>
        <th>Pointer</th>
    </tr>
