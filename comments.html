<h1>Comments</h1>

<p>
Comments are a very common element of programming languages.
They are used to add information for programmers to read, they help with
explaining the flow of the program, why some code exists, or to leave
some details on something that should be done later on.
</p>

<p>
C has two types of comments, often called single-line comments and multi-line comments.
</p>

<pre>
// this is a single-line comment

/* this is a
multi-line comment */
</pre>

<p>
Single-line comments are not available in C89. They were added in C99.
Meanwhile multi-line comments have been in the language since it was created. So it is
very common to see code use multi-line comments as single line comments like this:
</p>

<pre>
/* TODO: fix this code */
</pre>

<a href="hello-world.html">Previous: Hello World</a>
<a href="variables.html">Next: Variables</a>
</body>
